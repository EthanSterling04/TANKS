# TANKS

A two-player game where you fight each other in tanks! The last one standing wins!

## Instructions:

* Use WASD to move and V to shoot for player 1.
* Use Up, Down, Left, Right to move and M to shoot for player 2.
* Press 1 or 2 to choose a map and space to begin the fight!
* Light yellow walls can be broken with a bullet and will turn into gold walls. Gold walls can be shot through but you still cannot move through them.

## Specifications:

1. The players can choose between a number of maps to play on
2. The map is made by placing walls and breakable walls in set positions based on the map chosen
3. Each player is given a number of lives and each player's tank starts in a default position with a speed of 0
4. The wasd/up,left,down,right keys control a tank by turning/driving forward and backward
5. Each player can launch a missile every few seconds with v/m
6. When a missile is launched, it travels in the direction the tank was pointing with a given velocity
7. If the missile hits a wall, it is reflected off with the same speed
8. If the missile hits a breakable wall, the wall is "damaged" and players still can't drive through it but they can now shoot through it
9. After a duration, the missile is destroyed
10. If a missile hits a tank, the tank is destroyed and life is deducted from the player, every missile on the board is destroyed and both tanks respawn at their respective starting positions
11. After a player runs out of lives, the game ends, and the player with the remaining lives is set to be the winner
